    <h4>Stores game state between page reloads</h4>
      <div class="text-sub-block">
      <p>This game utilizes localStorage to preserve state between page reloads - meaning, you can reload the page as often as you want. You could even leave the game and come back to it next year, as long as you haven't cleared localStorage.</p>
        <span class="orange bordered">
          If you encounter a bug or the game freezes, your best bet is to clear
          localStorage via your browser's devtools!
        </span>
        <span class="orange bordered">
          This can also be accomplished by clicking the "RESET ALL" button in
          the Menu modal
