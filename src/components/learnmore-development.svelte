This is where I'll share a bit of a rough roadmap, a few features I want to add. I also want to share a bit of the technical basis of the app, and the work that went into it.

          Users can login, customize their profile and preferences, and track

          Currently, the game is single-device multiplayer. The most obvious
          improvement is to enable proper networked play. I'm expecting to
          implement a Websockets solution.

        <p>
          I have many ideas for adding complexity and options to the game; some
          specifically for this game, and other game ideas I've been collecting
          for two decades, some of which can be applied here.

    <h3>Developer Course</h3>
    <div class="text-content-block" id="two-setup-methods">
      <h4>How would you like to learn how to build this app?</h4>
      <div class="text-sub-block">
      <p>I want to help you learn how to code, design, and realize the web apps you envision!</p>
      <p>It's taken me years of discipline - blood, sweat and tears - to get to where I could build this on my own. Along the way, I've wasted an enormous amount of time and energy in deadends and poor practices. I sincerely want to help you learn better and faster than I did.</p>
        <p>
          I'm planning (once I've completed a few more features) to start again
          from scratch and rebuild this entire app - making videos of the
          process as I go, and creating a course to teach web app development
          with this game and website as a template.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have done a number of development courses on various subjects over
          the years, and most projects are very simple; you learn basics, but
          not how to integrate with other skills and technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          This app would be the most complex course learning project I'm aware
          of. With my skill and experience in teaching and instructing; the
          clarity with which I'm able to articulate and teach concepts,
          processes, and practices; and my broad knowledge of the development
          landscape and curation of excellent tools and resources, I know I can
          make a valuable contribution to the industry, and really help ordinary
          folks learn advanced web app development.

          posted on development of both the app and the course!
